pyvlfeat
========

A Python (cython) wrapper of the VLFeat library

We intend for this to be a light wrapper around the [VLFeat](http://www.vlfeat.org/) toolbox. pyvlfeat will provide a mixture of pure Python and Cython code that looks to replicate the existing Matlab toolbox. Cython is intended to fulfill the role of ``mex`` files.

We respect the original BSD 2-clause license and thus release this wrapper under the same license.

We thank the authors of VLFeat for their contribution to the computer vision community.
